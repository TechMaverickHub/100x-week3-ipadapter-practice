# 100x Week 3 â€” IPAdapter Practice (ComfyUI)

**Assignment (Practice Level):**  
Experiment with **IPAdapter in ComfyUI** to apply different style references to base images.  
The goal is to generate **multiple stylistic variations** while maintaining the subject's structure and identity.  

---

## âœ¨ Workflow Overview
This workflow focuses on:  
- Using **IPAdapter** to transfer style from reference images to base images.  
- Maintaining **subject structure** and natural appearance.  
- Experimenting with **different styles** to understand IPAdapter behavior.  

Key Components:  
- **IPAdapter Node:** Applies style from reference image.  
- **ComfyUI Workflow:** Chains nodes to generate outputs efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Layout
- `inputs/` â†’ base images for experimentation  
- `styles/` â†’ reference style images  
- `workflows/` â†’ ComfyUI workflow JSON for IPAdapter setup  
- `outputs/` â†’ generated images  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open **ComfyUI**.  
2. Load the workflow: `workflows/ipadapter_practice.json`.  
3. Place your **base images** in `inputs/`.  
4. Place style reference images in `styles/`.  
5. Run the workflow â†’ results saved in `outputs/`.

## âœ… Checklist
- [ ] Base images in `inputs/`  
- [ ] Style reference images in `styles/`  
- [ ] Workflow JSON in `workflows/`  
- [ ] Generated outputs in `outputs/`

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with **IPAdapter for style transfer**.  
- Understand how **reference images influence output**.  
- Practice maintaining **subject identity across different styles**.
